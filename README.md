## Calendar
A responsive, mobile friendly, progressive web app (PWA) made with React, moment.js and Immutable.js made to showcase my work and to learn new technologies.

* A Calendar with basic event functionality and basic state preservation by using local storage.
* A progressive web app - try accessing the demo from a phone and it should ask to be installed as a PWA. 
* Made in functional programming style - Immutable.js provides the data stuctures used for rendering the calendar.
* Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Live demo: https://andersgustafsson.nu/calendar

* Run `npm install`

### Running Local Development Server
